# bonsai

Worktree lifecycle as a small, cross-platform CLI. Bonsai owns one thing well:
creating, priming, and tearing down git worktrees, git-natively, with a safety
gate so work is never thrown away by accident.

It is deliberately distinct from raw `git worktree`: bonsai resolves the
freshest Git default branch, refuses to use a vaultsync-managed checkout as a
worktree factory, follows the `<root>/worktrees/<dir>` convention with a
self-ignoring `.gitignore`, primes a tree from a `.bonsai` file list, and guards
teardown. It emits facts (`--json`), never a start command or clipboard payload;
whatever launches an agent in the worktree composes its own briefing.

Use `bonsai` when an agent needs isolated workspace state without inventing a
repo-specific worktree ritual. It is especially useful before starting parallel
agent work, handing a mission to another runtime, or cleaning up old worktrees
without losing unmerged commits.

## Installation

```bash
claude plugins install bonsai@laicluse-agent-fieldkit
codex plugin add bonsai@laicluse-agent-fieldkit
```

## CLI

```
bonsai create <branch> --repo <root> [--base <ref>] [--json]
bonsai setup  <worktree> --repo <root> [--no-install] [--json]
bonsai teardown <worktree|branch> --repo <root> [--force] [--dry-run] [--json]
```

- **create**: resolve the freshest Git default branch from `origin/HEAD` when
  available, refuse a vaultsync-managed checkout through the vaultsync CLI, make
  the worktree + branch (slashes in the branch flatten to dashes in the dir),
  refuse an existing branch, and print `{ worktree, branch, base, baseSha, port
  }`. The port is a deterministic dev-server hint in 3100-3999.
- **setup**: copy the `.bonsai`-listed files from the canonical checkout
  (`--repo`) and install dependencies per directory by the manager each lockfile
  names. Install is best-effort; failures warn rather than block.
- **teardown**: remove a worktree only when it is integrated into the Git
  default branch, or clean with nothing ahead of that default. Otherwise it is
  kept with a reason. Warns on orphaned unpushed commits and on a diverged
  default. `--dry-run` classifies without removing; `--force` overrides the
  gate.

## Skills

- `bonsai`: make a ready worktree (create + setup).
- `setup`: prime an existing worktree.
- `prune`: tear down behind the safety gate.

## Files

- `bin/bonsai`: CLI dispatcher.
- `bin/bonsai-lib.mjs`: pure functions (base resolution, port, copy, install
  detection, teardown classification).
- `test/*.bats`: CLI contract tests.
