# autonomous

The layer that keeps an autonomous mission running across turns. It owns the
persistence workarounds an interactive session needs to stay alive (a cron
heartbeat with exponential backoff, auto-stop after sustained idleness, and
wake/restore after a session restart) and decides by itself whether any of that
machinery is needed.

The decision is a capability probe, not a caller flag. The `rover` plugin's
decision framework calls this layer once at dispatch and asks a single
question: am I in a persistent process, or an interactive session that pauses
between turns? The probe answers from the runtime.

## Why this is its own plugin

A cron heartbeat is a workaround for one fact: an interactive TUI session is
not a persistent process. It runs a turn, then waits for the operator, and an
autonomous loop in that session stops between turns unless something re-enters
the conversation. A detached process (an Agent SDK run, a conveyor line) has the
opposite shape: it keeps executing until the mission completes, so a heartbeat
there is dead weight.

Splitting the keep-alive machinery out of the decision framework means the
caller no longer has to know any of this. It invokes `rover`, the rover invokes
`autonomous:keepalive`, and the autonomy layer probes its own runtime and acts.

## Skills

All skills here are internal: the `rover` plugin loads them, the operator does
not invoke them directly.

- **`keepalive`**: the startup probe and front door. Checks whether `CronCreate`
  is available in this process. Available means an interactive session, so it
  arms a cron heartbeat through `cron` and returns the job id. Absent means a
  persistent process, so it arms nothing and reports back that the mission
  should just drive to completion.
- **`cron`**: the cadence machine. CronCreate, CronDelete, exponential backoff
  when the field goes quiet, auto-stop after sustained idleness, and cron
  restoration after a session restart.
- **`wake`**: bring a stalled mission back online. Reads the loop file, relights
  the cron, summarises where the traverse left off, and fires the next
  iteration. Reached via `rover:rover` with a loop-file path.

## The probe and its one assumption

The probe is correct only when need and availability coincide: a host that runs
a mission as a persistent process must withhold `CronCreate` (for example by
adding the cron tools to its disallowed-tools list), and a host whose sessions
go idle must expose it. When a persistent host still exposes the cron tools the
probe over-detects interactive and arms a heartbeat, but that heartbeat is
harmless: a one-shot process never goes idle, so the cron never fires and dies
with the process. See `skills/keepalive/SKILL.md` for the full contract.

## Companion plugin

The decision framework lives in `rover` (invoked as `/rover:...`). Install both
together:

```bash
claude plugins install autonomous@laicluse-agent-tools rover@laicluse-agent-tools
```
