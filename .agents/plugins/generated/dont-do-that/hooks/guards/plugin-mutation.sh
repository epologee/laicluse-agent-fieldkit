# PreToolUse:Bash guard for the plugin commands that change which code a machine loads. allow-comment: load-bearing contract. Only the set that adds, removes or disables is gated: install, uninstall, disable, and marketplace add or remove. Updating or enabling an already installed plugin is ordinary agent work and passes untouched, because activating merged work is the job, not a hazard. A gated command goes to the host's permission prompt where the operator sees one, and is refused elsewhere with the DD_PLUGIN_MUTATION=asked escape named in the denial, so an agent whose operator did ask is never stuck handing the command back. The guard never reads the operator's wording to infer consent: a keyword-and-verb match refuses real approvals phrased outside its vocabulary, accepts sentences that merely mention plugins, and turns every new phrasing into another regex.
